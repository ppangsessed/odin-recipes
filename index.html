        <h3>Rice mixed with vegetables, meat, an egg, and chili pepper paste</h3>

        <p>It’s made of a bowl of rice, sautéed and seasoned vegetables, a bit of hot pepper paste (gochujang), and usually a bit of seasoned raw beef, too. Bibim translates as “mixed,” and bap means “cooked rice,” so bibimbap literally means “mixed rice.” Before eating it you’re supposed to mix everything all together.</p>
