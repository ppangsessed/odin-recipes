        <p>Tiger nut milk drink is an easy to make drink that is also vegan friendly. While the name does include nut, its actually a tiny root vegetable.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Peeled tiger nut</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You'll also need a cheesecloth or other alternative to strain it and a pinch of salt.</p>
        <h2>Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You start by soaking the Tiger nuts overnight with a pinch of salt. This helps to soften them and reduce anti-nutrients</li>
            <li>Rinse them and blend with fresh, filtered water</li>
            <li>Once blended, it will look frothy, creamy and a lot like almond milk. Just like homemade almond milk, you need to use a nut milk bag to strain your tiger nut milk.</li>
            <li>Pour your blended tiger nut milk through a cheesecloth and squeeze into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour in desired storage container. Store in the fridge.</li>
        </ol>
